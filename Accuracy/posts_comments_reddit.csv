Again, leaning to the hopium side:

* Vacation delay: Wall street had some vacation too - like the guys in the marketing teams lol, so we see ads popping up now and as other folks (sales, fund managers etc.) return they'll continue making those (follow-up) calls, getting clearances on certain re-allocations etc. - think of the practical example of the recent fee war. This needs to be updated in a lot of documents.
* I know how I would sell an ETF right now (see my post above, should be a great entry now mid to long-term, vs. local top, vs. ATH and in light of halving). A sales-oriented person can sell a dip as something positive.
* Lag in accessibility to the ETFs was an issue (e.g. Robinhood for retail).
* I'd expect the sell-the-news-crowd (that's volume not directly related to ETF flows) sold pretty instantly.

So I'm slightly optimistic we'll continue seeing good inflows but outflows at Grayscale \[Edit: and sells in the general market\] reduce.

In other news, RSI, Fear & greed and other more important metrics have calmed down. Mainly, [open interest](https://www.coinglass.com/en/BitcoinOpenInterest) took a big hit (I'm one example that has de-leveraged). But then again, I'm biased and really hope some others have more bearish takes (please share).

Major-Reputation-404,19a7tfd,How Grayscale is Dumping BTC and Why You Shouldn’t Panic,"Hi, fellow Bitcoiners! 

You may have noticed that the price of BTC has been dropping lately, and you may be wondering what’s going on. I’ll share my opinion with some data.

Well, one of the main reasons is that Grayscale, the largest Bitcoin fund in the world, is selling some of its BTC to meet the redemption requests of its investors.

But before you freak out and sell your BTC, let me explain why this is happening and why it’s not a bad thing in the long term.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is a fund that allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to buy or store it directly. It has been around since 2013 and has accumulated over 600,000 BTC, making it the second-largest holder of Bitcoin after Satoshi Nakamoto.

However, GBTC has been facing some challenges recently due to the emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. These ETFs are funds that track the price of Bitcoin more closely and charge lower fees than GBTC. 

As a result, many investors decided to switch from GBTC to the new ETFs, creating a massive outflow of capital from GBTC.

**There are two main reasons why investors are leaving GBTC:**

1. Grayscale charges a 1.5% annual management fee for GBTC, which is 5 to 6 times higher than the fees of other ETF issuers, such as ProShares and Valkyrie, which charge 0.3% and 0.25%, respectively. 

2. Many investors bought GBTC at a 40% discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the fund, hoping to profit from the premium that GBTC used to enjoy. However, the premium has turned into a discount of around 0%, making GBTC less attractive than the spot ETFs.

To meet the redemption requests of the investors, GBTC has to sell some of the Bitcoin it holds and transfer the proceeds to the investors. According to data from CryptoQuant, Grayscale has moved over 41,000 BTC worth over $1.7 billion to Coinbase Prime since January 12, 2024. This selling pressure has contributed to the decline of the Bitcoin price, which has dropped below $43,000 as of January 18, 2024.

**How Long Will This Last?**

The GBTC outflows may continue for a few more weeks, as investors adjust their portfolios and seek better alternatives. During this period, the Bitcoin price may face more volatility and downward pressure. However, once the situation stabilizes, the investors who sold GBTC may reinvest their money into other ETFs that have lower fees and better tracking of the Bitcoin price. This could boost the demand for Bitcoin and support its recovery in the long term.

Therefore, it is important to have patience and not panic during this transitional phase. Bitcoin is still a valuable asset that has a lot of potential for growth and innovation. Remember, this is a long-term game!

What do you think of this situation?",19/01/2024 3:11,405,kik5kkw,t3_19a7tfd,This scenario is accurate and also presents a great opportunity to top up BTC. I’m poised for short spikes downward to buy more. Set those limit orders in!,19/01/2024 8:35,Bitcoin,POSITIVE,9.69E+12,2.03E+13,8748,Positive,Positive

i graphed the history of coins with over $1b market cap, based on coinmarketcap's [historical snapshots](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/) page

this first chart is for weekly number of coins over $1b cap since beginning of 2020: https://i.imgur.com/oq8k7oH.png

this second chart is since 2017: https://i.imgur.com/yEbBcbq.png
